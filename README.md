# Twitter Sentiment Analysis

In this project, I have implemented a Twitter Sentiment Analysis that will retrieve tweets from Twitter API and analyze them as positive, negative or neutral using TEXTBLOB.
This helps to overcome the challenges of identifying the sentiments of the tweets often used by businesses to detect sentiment in social data, gauge brand reputation, and understand customers.

TWEEPY and NLTK module were used for gathering tweets and preprocessing the tweets respectively.
